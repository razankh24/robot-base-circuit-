# task 2: robot-base-circuit:

this reposetory contains:

A- a circuit controlling 2 DC motors by ardiuno:
    
    * 2 DC motors 
    
    *ardiuno 
    
    *H-bridge motor driver 
    
    *a battery
    
    *code file

    B- the used battery is (Li-Ion battery) 
    
    after a good reaserch I calculated the following data about the arm robot/base components:
    
    5 servos>> 4.8v to 6v each 
    
    DC motor>> 3v to 12v dependng on its size, and usually about 100mA
    
    ardiuno>> 6v , and 40mA
    
    which is 6v and roughly 140mA, and that's why i choose a lithium battery as the the most suitable to our robot, since Li-Ion batteries has higher energy power and a voltage
    
    from 4.2v to 4.3v which is whithin the range of voltages that is needed. however, it might be not so friendly in terms of price,and That's because the materials needed in
    
    cathodes to pack in more energy are often expensive. but Hey! it will last from 2-3 years and provide us with higher energy plus it's rechargable!! 
    
    
    
    speaking of rechargeability! i build a circuit for reacharing lithium battery in CircuitLab
